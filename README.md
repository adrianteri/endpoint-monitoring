# A service to monitor endpoints

A repo to monitor endpoints(APIs, HTTP(s) etc)

## ToDo's
- Implement minimal instruments:
 - pings,
 - etc ...
- create config to load and validate endpoints are reachable
- Decide on storage of trends... timeseries db?
- Create minimal UI to visulaize trends or re-use/extend tooling such as Grafana dashboards
- Create a list/config of my important sites.
